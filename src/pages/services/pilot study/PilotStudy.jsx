                  A pilot study, or feasibility study, is a small-scale version
                  of a full-scale study used to test research instruments and
                  methods. It helps identify potential issues and refine
                  research design, increasing the likelihood of success in the
                  main study. Conducting a pilot study allows researchers to
                  gather feedback, adjust hypotheses, and improve clarity and
                  effectiveness, which ultimately enhances the main study's
                  chances of success. It is applicable in qualitative,
                  quantitative, and mixed methods research.

                  Ph.D. Assistance offers expert support to conduct effective
                  pilot studies, addressing challenges faced by scholars new to
                  academic research or those with teaching experience who lack
                  time for extensive literature reviews. By conducting a pilot
                  study, researchers can identify participant recruitment
                  issues, refine research instruments, and save time and
                  resources. This support is crucial for developing a clear
                  research design and ensuring a successful transition to
                  full-scale research projects.
