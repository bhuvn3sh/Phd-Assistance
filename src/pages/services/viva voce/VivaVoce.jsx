                  The Ph.D. viva is a crucial part of the examination process,
                  typically conducted "behind closed doors," though some
                  institutions hold "public" vivas with restricted access. The
                  purpose of the viva is to showcase your research, demonstrate
                  your understanding and ability to defend your work verbally,
                  and assess your overall awareness of your research topic.
                  During the presentation, you should cover the problem
                  statement, its significance, your study's findings, tools
                  used, any relevant publications, conferences, and awards.
                  Ensure to include in-text references, avoid simply reading
                  slides, and conclude with an acknowledgment slide.
