                      All our academic mentoring ensures proper acknowledgment
                      of sources to aid readers in finding relevant materials
                      and to avoid plagiarism. References are primarily included
                      in the main body of your work, with the introduction and
                      conclusion focusing on original ideas. Citations are
                      in-text and linked to the full references at the end.

                      The research report is formatted according to the specific
                      guidelines provided by the scholars, such as APA, MLA,
                      Harvard, or Oxford. This ensures proper citation to avoid
                      plagiarism, assign authority to statements, and improve
                      sentence structure. Additionally, we include a table of
                      contents, lists of tables and figures, and manage
